Health Insurance Claim Prediction
This project presents a real-world machine learning model designed for smart triage of health insurance claims in a national healthcare system.

The model predicts whether a claim file requires manual expert review to determine potential deductions or not.

Prediction = 0 ‚Üí The claim likely has no deductions ‚Üí No need for manual assessment
Prediction = 1 ‚Üí The claim may have deductions ‚Üí Send to assessor for review
This approach helps automate the screening of claim files, reduce expert workload, and speed up the processing pipeline.
